    <h1><center>My Holy Week Vacation</center></h1>

    <p>
        My family and I were traveling to a different planet when we chose to take a vacation during Holy Week. just kidding!. The reality was far more straightforward: we were traveling to our home province of Bulacan in order to pay tribute to our late grandparents and reunite with our extended family.
    </p>

    <p>
        We set off on a road trip to our family's homeland, full of excitement and anticipation. As we traveled, we exchanged laughs, stories, and snacks, making priceless memories that would last long after the trip was over.
    </p>

    <p>
        We were greeted with open arms by family members in Bulacan who were happy to catch up and celebrate the holiday together. Warm chats, delectable home-cooked meals, and the renewal of family ties all occurred during our vacation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our journey was primarily intended as a means of honoring our deceased grandparents. As a show of affection and remembrance, we went to their final resting place and brought flowers and prayers. The event served as a moving reminder of the value of family and the ongoing impact of our ancestors.
    </p>

    <p>
        BesidesÂ paying tribute to our forefathers, we enjoyed Bulacan's scenic vistas and historical landmarks. We enhanced our vacation experience by visiting nearby attractions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We returned home at the end of Holy Week, filled with gratitude and a greater understanding of our familial ties. We were taken to a world of love, enduring familial ties, and common customs, even though the journey was not to another planet.

            I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
            I threw the day old tea from the cup
            Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
            Memories of a life that's been loved
            Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
            Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
            Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
            But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
            A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
        </p>
        <p>
            So I'll sing Hallelujah
            You were an angel in the shape of my mum
            When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
            Spread your wings as you go
            And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
            You're home
        </p>
        <p>
            Fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
            Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
            John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
            And wiped a tear from the side of my face
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
            A life with love is a life that's been lived
        </p>
        <p>
            So I'll sing Hallelujah
            You were an angel in the shape of my mum
            When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
            Spread your wings as you go
            And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
            You're home
        </p>
        <p>Hallelujah
            You were an angel in the shape of my mum
            You got to see the person I have become
            Spread your wings and I know
            That when God took you back he said Hallelujah
            You're home.</p>
        <p><b>"I may not have understood the instructions clearly, whether to insert the lyrics of my favorite song or simply explain why it's my favorite, but I'll do both. 'Supermarket Flowers' is one of my favorite songs because it brings back memories of my grandparents, Lolo and Lola, who are now in heaven and greatly missed. The song is particularly poignant for me as it is sung from the perspective of the artist's mother, who has passed away, adding an extra layer of emotional resonance to the lyrics. My childhood feels incomplete without my grandparents, and this song beautifully captures the bittersweet nostalgia and the enduring love I have for them."</b></p>
